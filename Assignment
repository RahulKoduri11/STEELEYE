React Component Code Review


---->  Based on the code below answer the following queries:

1 .Explain what the simple List component does.

ANS ---->
          ⦿  A list is used to store multiple items of the same and different datatype under a variable. It is basically an array. We can perform various operations on it such as .map() to loop over the list/array to list down all the elements. There is also a memo method used in the list component. React reuses the memoized content from the same reference. It makes the website speed and performance more efficient and better.
          ⦿  Simple list component accepts various props and renders a list item on the page and background color of list item is determined by isSelected prop. If item is selected then background color of item is green else background color is red by default.


2 .What problems / warnings are there with code?
ANS-----> 
    In list item's onClick method there is a function call but onClick accepts function's reference.
        ⦿ CODE
     <li style={{ backgroundColor: isSelected ? "green" : "red" }}
     onClick={onClickHandler(index)}>
      {text}
     </li>

   Syntatical error in returned value of useState()
 ⦿ CODE
 const [setSelectedIndex, selectedIndex] = useState();
 
   Passing incorrect propType value in isSelected. Proptype defined is bool but here passed proptype is number
 ⦿ CODE
 <ul style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
       {items.map((item, index) => (
        <SingleListItem
          onClickHandler={() => handleClick(index)}
          text={item.text}
          index={index}
          isSelected={selectedIndex}
        />
      ))}
</ul>


    Items Array is null and iterating over null array is not possible or may cause run-time error
 ⦿ CODE 
 WrappedListComponent.defaultProps = {
  items: null,
};

    Syntatical error in following code
 ⦿ CODE   
    WrappedListComponent.propTypes = {
  items: PropTypes.array(
    PropTypes.shapeOf({
      text: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    })
  ),
};

    Key prop is not present for uniquely identify each element
 ⦿ CODE 
<ul style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <SingleListItem
          onClickHandler={() => handleClick(index)}
          text={item.text}
          index={index}
          isSelected={selectedIndex}
        />
      ))}
</ul>


3 .Please fix, optimize, and/or modify the component as much as you think is necessary.
